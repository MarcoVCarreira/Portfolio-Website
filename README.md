This is a personal portfolio website design I made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. In this website design I will add name, designation of the user. Then I will display the image, skills, work experience and education details. I will also add the list of services and work portfolio on this website. In the footer of this website we will add contact info and contact form. Your can receive the contact form data on your google sheets.
This website design will be completely responsive for all screen devices like mobile phones.


Please have a look at the Portfolio Website,  here is the link- https://marcovcarreira.github.io/Portfolio-Website/
